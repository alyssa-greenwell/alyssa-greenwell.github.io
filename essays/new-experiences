*Wisdom is earned through experience.*

I was taught this from a young age, too young to even remember who said it to me. I always understood the lesson. The more things you experience in your life, the more lessons you’ve learned, the wiser you are. It makes sense, logically. What I failed to understand until relatively recently was just how relevant this sentiment is to all aspects of my life. I’m young, not even 20 years old. I don’t have all that much of either of those things. And I’m just now starting to understand how much I don’t know.

## In Personal Affairs

Growing up in small-town Hawaii, new experiences were hard to come by. The day-to-days were the same. It was comfortable; perhaps a tad boring, but easy nonetheless. It wasn’t until I started college that I realized just how naive that lifestyle made me. In the year and a half I’ve been in college, I’ve made new relationships, new connections, and most importantly, experienced things that have changed the way I see the world. In a year and a half, I’ve lived away from my parents, gotten in a car accident, ate Indian food for the first time, and made friends from around the world. All of these experiences have had their impact on me as a person. From these experiences, I’ve gained more wisdom in the last year and a half than I have in my whole life. I seek out new experiences now. Even though it can be uncomfortable and scary at times, I want to try a bit of everything, and find the lessons waiting to be learned.

## In Computer Science

I’m only in my second year of college. I’d be lying if I said that I know what I want to do in the future. I’ve never had a clue what I’m doing, or where I’m going. But the experiences that I’ve had so far have taught me that I love programming and computer science. I guess that’s something, though clearly I’m clueless when it comes to my professional career. As of right now, the only thing I know I want to do is to experience more. Take the wisdom I’ve earned and expand on it. I want to experience software engineering, game development, cybersecurity, and anything else I can get my hands on. I want to try to seize every opportunity that comes to me. Find the things I like, and the ones I don’t. I have to build the wisdom I need before I figure out where I’m going in my professional career. It’s a new and exciting journey, and I can’t wait to see what comes next.
