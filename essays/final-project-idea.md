# Project: Course Finder

Proposal Written collaboratively by Alyssa Greenwell & Jing Ting Zheng

## Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)

Problem: There are many different classes that can satisfy graduation requirements at UH Manoa. There can be many different classes that can be taken for a requirement like DS or WI. Some of these classes vary in terms of the difficulty. Typically, if a student wanted to see the difficulty of class, they would look for professor reviews or reviews from their peers. Moreover, it is difficult to sort by interests when looking for the perfect class. 
Solution: The Course finder allows students to search for classes based on requirements, interest, and difficulty rating to find the class that will best fit their needs.

## Approach

The app will feature an advanced search function for students to find different classes. This will be based on tags added to the class and a difficulty rating of the class. There will also be a feature for previous students to leave a review for the class and assign what they think the difficulty rating is.

Mockup page ideas:

* Landing page
* Student home page
* Admin home page
* Student search page
* Student review page
* Admin add page
* Admin edit page

## Use case ideas

* New user goes to landing, creates an account, and logs into the home page.
* User goes to landing, logs in to their home page, looks at available classes.
* Admin logs into account, adds a new class.
* Admin logs into account, edits a class.

## Beyond the basics

* Student uses an advanced search function to filter classes by difficulty and tags
* Student leaves a review on a class and assigns a difficulty rating
* A difficulty rating is assigned to a class by averaging the student rated difficulty
* Admins are notified when a new review is added to a class to check for appropriateness
