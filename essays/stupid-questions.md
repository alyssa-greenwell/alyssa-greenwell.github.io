We’ve all heard the saying “There are no stupid questions.” Whether that’s true or not is debatable; though in the age of internet forums, I’d say that some questions are better than others. As a computer science student, I frequent the popular internet forum StackOverflow whenever something goes wrong. It is an incredibly helpful tool that almost anyone who’s coded before knows about. But there are good and bad ways to ask questions, and that can be seen clearly on StackOverflow.

## A Smart Question

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68387270/android-studio-error-installed-build-tools-revision-31-0-0-is-corrupted/68430992#68430992)is an example of a good question from StackOverflow. This user is trying to set up Android Studio and run a simple “Hello World!” project, but is having trouble building or running anything. They’ve included a copy of the error message they’ve gotten, as well as a list of the failed solutions they have already tried. This question is specific,complete with a clear and concise headline and the specific software they are using down to the version, so there is no confusion. The user has clearly looked up solutions and worked through the issue themself to no avail before coming to the forum. It is an excellent example of a good question. My only critique for this question is that the user is somewhat blaming the software for their misfortune, stating that it shouldn’t be this difficult to set up a simple project. Here, they’re making the mistake of blaming the software instead of admitting they might be doing something wrong. However, given the context of the question and the fact that they have tried so many things to solve the problem, it’s understandable that they would be frustrated. I’m just being nitpicky.

## A Stupid Question

To contrast, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1789945/how-to-check-whether-a-string-contains-a-substring-in-javascript/1789952#1789952) is an example of a dumb question. Ironically, it’s got considerably more upvotes than the last question, most likely just because it is a more common question. Regardless, the question is “How to check whether a string contains a substring in JavaScript?” The user goes on to say they would expect there to be a string.contains() method, but there isn’t one. And that’s it. No comment on what kind of software they’re using, or what they’ve tried already. On top of that, this question begs for an RTFM answer. Out of curiosity I googled this question, specifically typing “check if string contains substring javascript.” The very first result gave me the answer I was looking for (Which is, by the way, the includes() method). Obviously, this user didn’t bother even attempting to troubleshoot this by themself before asking for help. Furthermore, the kind people who gave this question the time of day and answered it didn’t know what kind of software this person was using, and had to give multiple different answers, since the include() method is not supported by Internet Explorer. This question was unthoughtful, unnecessary, and arrogant.

## Final Thoughts

So yes, there is such a thing as a stupid question. However, whether a question is smart or stupid has nothing to do with the content of the question itself. Take the smart question I listed for example; the user was simply trying to write a “Hello World!” program on a new IDE. The fact that the user was struggling with a relatively simple task had no impact on how smart or stupid their question was. It’s all to do with the way you ask the question. A smart question is thoughtful, specific, and asked only after you have troubleshooted the issue yourself. It doesn’t matter how simple the problem is. Any question can be a smart question if asked correctly, and in order to be successful in the computer science field, it is important to know the difference.
