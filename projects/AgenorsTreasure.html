 <p>Agenor’s Treasure is a pirate-themed text adventure game that I developed for my Intro to Computer Science II class at University of Hawaii at Hilo. It is an RPG style game with some basic combat, where the goal is to find the pirate’s treasure by interacting with NPC’s and completing quests.</p>

<p>Here is an example the beginning of the game:</p>

<hr />

<pre>
Welcome to Agenor's Treasure! Would you like instructions?
Y: yes
N: No

N

You are in a small Tavern, in the little town of Trudid. Behind the bar is the Tavern-keeper, Earl. There is a door leading outside.
T: talk to Tavern-keeper
O: go outside

T

Earl: Ah, hello old friend! What brings you here today?
Press ENTER to continue

Earl: Agenor, you say? The greatest pirate of all time? Yes, of course I've heard of him. 

Earl: I see. You're looking for his treasure. That's a dangerous mission, my friend. Many have sought it before, but none have survived 
the journey. Are you sure you want to do this?

Earl: Yes, yes, I suppose you are. Well then, I do know someone who may be able to help you. Sail east of here, and find the city of Ajun. 
Talk to Hob, tell him I sent you. You'll find him on the docks. Careful though. He drives a hard bargain.

Earl: Here, I'll mark Ajun on your map. 
(press 'M' while sailing on your ship to look at your map.)

Earl: Good luck, pirate!

You are in a small Tavern, in the little town of Trudid. Behind the bar is the Tavern-keeper, Earl. There is a door leading outside.

O

You are on the docks of the town of Trudid. Your ship is docked nearby. Up the hill, there is a small Tavern.
